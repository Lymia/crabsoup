# crabsoup

crabsoup is a static website generator based on [Soupault], but rewritten in Rust. It decodes your website content into HTML DOMs using modern libraries, and allows you to manipulate them with [Luau] scripts.

It aims for "practical" compatibility with Soupault, similar to TeX variants. Most common Soupault websites and plugins will work without modification, but many edge cases will behave differently due to the different underlying code.
